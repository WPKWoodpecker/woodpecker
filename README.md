Predicting the market is one of the platforms that individuals can bet on the outcome of future events. It provides a predictor with a knowledge of it

Opportunities for the monetization of knowledge and ability. Those who can accurately predict the outcome will benefit in the long run and best.

The forecaster will be the most profitable person.

Today, many block chain projects are trying to devolve decentralization into this field. It's a destructive economy.

Before innovation, it is only a matter of time to provide the public with such monetization opportunities.

Our project aims at the latest developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning on these platforms, including forecasting the market.

Field, exchange and sports books.

Woodpecker is a complex prediction model based on neural network system. Each network performs a specific task,

And their collaboration produces highly accurate predictions. The backbone of woodpecker is its modular architecture. It makes

We can develop and implement individual prediction modules for different types of forecasting domains, from business and finance to body.

Education and politics.

The woodpecker fund is the core element of the project. Apply the prediction model to multiple platforms and transfer profits.

Intelligent contracts are provided for further distribution between token holders.

Finally, the woodpecker token (WPK WPK) performs two types of functions in the system: allowing the holder to move from place to place.

There is a dividend in the operation of the fund, and it provides voting rights for the project development through the voting mechanism on the block chain.
